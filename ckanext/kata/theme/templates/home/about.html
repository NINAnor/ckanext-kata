            <h2>About the Kata metadata catalogue</h2>
            <p>
             Kata collects metadata of research data from various external sources
             as well as provides a web interface to add metadata straight into Kata.
             Actual research data is never stored in Kata so it can be placed
             anywhere but with the help of Kata it can be found by anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Comprehensive depiction of data plays a very important role in visibility
             of data. Kata encourages this by adapting the minimum metadata model and
             its discipline independent metadata fields. With the help of Kata's various
             tools adding the common metadata fields is made easier. The service also
             promotes adding unified information about usability, ownership and licensing of data.
             Important data to funders is also provided which promotes reporting.
             Kata's powerful search tools will make the data easier to find, which also helps in
             bringing merit to the researchers.
            </p>
