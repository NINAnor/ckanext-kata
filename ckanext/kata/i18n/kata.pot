" <h2>About Etsin</h2> <p> Etsin is a research data finder. In the service you"
" can search and find data from various fields of research. The metadata "
"contained in Etsin makes it easy for anyone to discover the datasets. Etsin "
"makes it possible to enter metadata on datasets into the service, making them"
" discoverable and reusable for others. The actual research data may be stored"
" anywhere and the owner controls the access to the data. Etsin also gathers "
"metadata about existing research data from various external sources, such as "
"the <a href=\"http://www.fsd.uta.fi/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Finnish Social "
"Science Data Archive.</a> </p> <p> Good description of data plays a very "
"important role in the visibility of the data. Etsin encourages comprehensive "
"descriptions by adapting a common set of discipline independent metadata "
"fields and by making it easy to enter metadata.The service also promotes "
"adding unified information about the availability, ownership and licensing of"
" data. The goal is to foster licensing practices for research data. The "
"functionalities of Etsin help document researchers' merits in collecting and "
"sharing data. The information on datasets and project funding also makes the "
"results of research more transparent to funders. </p> <p> In addition to the "
"graphical user interface, data in Etsin may be used through an <a "
"href=\"http://etsin.avointiede.fi/api/3/\" target=\"_blank\">open "
"interface</a>. <a href=\"http://docs.ckan.org/en/ckan-2.1.2/api.html\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Documentation of the API</a> may be found on the CKAN "
"pages. </p> <p> All dataset descriptions are made available under <a "
"href=\"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Creative Commons 0 license</a>. Data owners decide on the "
"licence of the research data described in Etsin. For open data, <a "

"<p> Customer service contacts and feedback should be addressed to servicedesk"
" (at) csc.fi. The service maintenance window is on the fourth Monday of every"
" month between 4 and 6 PM (EST). During that time, the service will be out of"
" use. </p> <p> Etsin is offered to the scientific community by the Ministry "
