" <h2>About Etsin</h2> <p> Etsin is a service for finding and browsing "
"datasets from various fields of research. Etsin gathers metadata of research "
"data from various external sources and also provides a web interface to enter"
" metadata directly into the service. Actual research data is never stored in "
"Etsin and as such it can be stored anywhere at the discretion of the owner of"
" the data. However, by gathering the metadata in a single service, Etsin "
"allows anyone to easily find the data. </p> <p> Comprehensive description of "
"data plays a very important role in the visibility of the data. Etsin "
"encourages this by adapting a common set of discipline-independent metadata "
"fields and by making it easy to enter new metadata. The service also promotes"
" adding unified information about the availability, ownership and licensing "
"of data. Increased visibility and findability of the data promotes data reuse"
" and helps bring merit to researchers. It also makes the results of research "
"more transparent to funders. </p> <p> Etsin is provided by the Ministry of "
"Education and Culture of Finland. Etsin is maintained by CSC ‚Äî IT Center for "
"Science Ltd. The service is discipline independent and free to use. </p> "
