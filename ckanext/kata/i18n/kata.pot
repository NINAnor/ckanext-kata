"terms and finds a matching dataset if either of the terms exist in a dataset."

" of the word OR.<br /> <br /> To search for datasets that contain either "
"\"2005\" or \"2007\" in their title use the query:<br /> <br /> Example:<br "
"/> <br /> title:2005 OR title:2007<br /> <br /> The AND operator matches "
